The Net crew is excited to welcome Greg Ferro to the show. We talk about the
changing networking landscape. We dabble with a bit of 5G discussions and wax
poetic about online conferencing tools. And we touch on the changing landscape
of conferences and events in a post-COVID world. Finally, we noodle on work
from home and how COVID is upending employee expectations.
