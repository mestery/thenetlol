Al Lynn and Vinny Parla join The Net crew to discuss how you can get to the
"Left of Boom." Al explains how he came up with this acronym, and how it
applies to enterprises. We also talk about the current CVE explosion, and how
insider threats are just as important to understand for risk mitigation. You
